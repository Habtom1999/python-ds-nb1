# Project 2
Python Data Structures and Notebooks

# Objectives
This exercise is used to reinforce key Python concepts including data structures, functions, and more

# Get Started
1. Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  2. The base repository is available at: <https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/python-ds-nb/blob/main/python-ds.ipynbLinks> to an external site.
On your machine, 
3. Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.
4. Use VS Code for this step - or you can use Git Bash, or if Windows, TortoiseGit or other.

# Open Notebook and Complete Tasks
1. On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing.
2. Or use VS Code for this step - some will run jupyter lab.  
3. In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to your GitHub repo after your name. 
4. Required: Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number.
5. Complete the first task.
6. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
7. Complete the second task.
8. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
9. Work this way until all tasks have been completed.

# Task 3. Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
1. Export each notebook to HTML to see what web pages look like.
2. Use Jupyter to export your .ipynb files as HTML.
3. Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
